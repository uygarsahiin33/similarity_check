# Similarity Checker for Products
### Important Note : Due to company data confidentiality and security policies, real data is not provided or displayed. All the data used in this project description is a dummy dataset designed to mimic the statistical behavior of the original data.
This project converts specific product attributes into vectors so that each product can be represented numerically. By comparing the angle between two product vectors and evaluating their cosine similarity, one can determine how similar the products are to one another.
